The objective of implementing OTP verification using Python is to enhance the security and reliability of user authentication in applications or systems. By utilizing OTPs, the objective is to provide a secure and one-time means of verifying the identity of users before granting them access to sensitive resources. This helps prevent unauthorized access, protect user accounts, and ensure that only legitimate users can perform critical actions within the system. Overall, the objective is to strengthen the security posture and user trust in the application or system.
